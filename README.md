# Decidim::AccountabilitySimple

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mainio/decidim-module-accountability_simple/actions/workflows/ci_accountability_simple.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mainio/decidim-module-accountability_simple/actions)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mainio/decidim-module-accountability_simple/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mainio/decidim-module-accountability_simple)

The gem has been developed by [Mainio Tech](https://www.mainiotech.fi/).

Simplifies the user interface of the accountability module for clearer
display of the results.

Development of this gem has been sponsored by the
[City of Helsinki](https://www.hel.fi/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-accountability_simple"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rails decidim_locations:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rails decidim_accountability_simple:install:migrations
$ bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

This gem works out of the box for the accountability module, so there is no
extra system configuration needed to use it. It overrides some of the
accountability module's views in order to simplify them.

For the accountability results, there are two new fields for the images that
can be used to configure the images visible on the result listing and display
pages.

## Contributing

See [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

### Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
$ cd development_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rails s
```

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

#### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Atom - [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

If you want to generate the code coverage report for the tests, you can use
the `SIMPLECOV=1` environment variable in the rspec command as follows:

```bash
$ SIMPLECOV=1 bundle exec rspec
```

This will generate a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.
